# ðŸŒŠ UCL Underwater Glider - Arduino Testing Code

This repository contains the **initial Arduino-based control software** developed for the **UCL Underwater Glider project**. The code focuses on testing individual subsystems such as variable buoyancy control, pitch and roll mechanisms, sensor integration, and communication modules prior to full software integration.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
The UCL Underwater Glider is a student-led initiative aimed at developing a **modular, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)** for oceanographic research. The design uses a **blended-wing structure**, innovative buoyancy systems, and distributed control via multiple Arduino microcontrollers.

This repo includes early-stage test code for:
- Variable Buoyancy Device (VBD) mechanisms
- Pitch and roll actuation
- Sensor interfacing (e.g. pressure sensors, IMU, sonar)
- Communication systems (RS485 tether)
